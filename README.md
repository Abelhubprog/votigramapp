**A blockchain-powered, human-verified voting and public participation platform with a Kenya-first approach.**

## üìë Overview

Votigram is a comprehensive platform that combines blockchain technology, zero-knowledge proofs, and inclusive design to create a trusted ecosystem for digital voting and public participation. It features geotagged polls, live audio/video discussions, offline participation methods, and a social feed with transparent metrics.

### Core Features

- **Tamper-proof voting** via blockchain integration
- **Human-only verification** using WorldID or other zero-knowledge proof systems
- **Inclusive participation** through web, mobile, USSD, SMS, and local kiosks
- **Live engagement** with audio/video rooms and real-time polling
- **Social feed** with transparent distribution and advanced metrics
- **Multi-language support** starting with English and Swahili

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

Votigram employs a layered architecture:

### Frontend Layer

- Next.js 13+ with App Router for SSR and dynamic routing
- TypeScript for type safety
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- React-based components with Context/Redux state management
- PWA capabilities for offline caching

### Backend Layer

- Node.js with NestJS framework
- PostgreSQL with PostGIS for geospatial data
- Redis for caching and real-time updates
- WebSockets for live updates and streaming
- Microservices architecture for scalability

### Blockchain Layer

- Smart contracts on Polygon or other L2 networks
- Core contracts include PollFactory, PollContract, and ZK Verification
- Minimal on-chain data with IPFS for metadata storage

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18+)
- Docker and Docker Compose
- PostgreSQL (v14+)
- Redis (v6+)
- Polygon node access (or testnet)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/votigram.git
   cd votigram
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   # Install frontend dependencies
   cd frontend
   npm install
   
   # Install backend dependencies
   cd ../api
   npm install
   
   # Install contract dependencies
   cd ../contracts
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   ```bash
   # Copy environment examples
   cp frontend/.env.example frontend/.env.local
   cp api/.env.example api/.env
   ```

4. Start the development servers:
   ```bash
   # Start backend services using Docker
   docker-compose up -d
   
   # Start API server
   cd api
   npm run start:dev

## üì± Usage Examples

### Creating a Poll

```javascript
// Using the API
const createPoll = async () => {
  const response = await fetch('/api/polls', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      title: 'Community Road Project',
      description: 'Which road should be prioritized for repair?',
      options: [
        { text: 'Main Street' },
        { text: 'Elm Street' },
        { text: 'Oak Avenue' }
      ],
      startTime: new Date(),
      endTime: new Date(Date.now() + 86400000), // 1 day later
      geoRestriction: 'COUNTY_001'
    })
  });
  
  return response.json();
};
```

### Voting in a Poll

```javascript
// Using the API
const castVote = async (pollId, optionId) => {
  const response = await fetch('/api/votes', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      pollId,
      option: optionId
    })
  });
  
  return response.json();
};
```
